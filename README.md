This is my personal documentation site. I've written up a lot of notes and guides over the years, but they've just been sitting in my Obsidian.md notepad really only helping me. This site aims to change that. My goal is to curate the existing guides I have, including everything from my experience managing media systems to web servers, automation, and more, and compartimentalize it all together in a single site that allows you to avoid problems that I had, and get your own home lab or hosting systems online faster.

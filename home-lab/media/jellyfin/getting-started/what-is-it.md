# What is Jellyfin?

Jellyfin is a free and open-source media system that puts you in control of your media. It's a powerful alternative to proprietary solutions like Plex or Emby, allowing you to organize, manage, and stream your personal collection of movies, TV shows, music, photos, and more, to almost any device.

## Key Features of Jellyfin

* **Self-Hosted Freedom:** Unlike many commercial media servers, Jellyfin is designed to be self-hosted. This means you install and run the server software on your own computer, server, or even a network-attached storage (NAS) device. You retain full control over your data, privacy, and how your media is accessed.
* **Broad Device Support:** Jellyfin offers a wide range of client applications for various platforms, including:
    * Web browsers (via their intuitive web interface)
    * Mobile devices (Android, iOS)
    * Smart TVs (Android TV, Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV)
    * Gaming consoles (Xbox, PlayStation)
    * Dedicated media players
    * And more, ensuring you can enjoy your media almost anywhere.
* **Live TV & DVR:** If you have an antenna and a compatible TV tuner, Jellyfin can integrate with your setup to provide live TV streaming and DVR (Digital Video Recorder) functionality. This allows you to watch and record broadcast television directly through Jellyfin.
* **Metadata & Organization:** Jellyfin excels at automatically pulling in rich metadata for your media, including cover art, plot summaries, cast information, release dates, and more. This helps you keep your library beautifully organized and easily searchable.
* **Customization:** As an open-source project, Jellyfin is highly customizable. You can personalize your server's appearance with themes, configure transcoding settings to optimize streaming for different devices, and even extend its functionality with community-developed plugins.
* **No DRM or Licensing Fees:** Being open-source means there are no digital rights management (DRM) restrictions, no recurring subscription fees, and no limitations on how you use your own media.

## How Does it Work?

At its core, Jellyfin consists of two main components:

1.  **Jellyfin Server:** This is the backend software you install on your chosen device. It scans your media files, organizes them, fetches metadata, and handles the streaming process.
2.  **Jellyfin Clients:** These are the applications you use on your playback devices (phone, TV, browser, etc.) to connect to your Jellyfin server and stream your content.

When you want to watch a movie, your client device requests the content from your Jellyfin server. The server then transcodes the video on the fly if necessary (to ensure compatibility with your device and network conditions) and streams it to your client.

## Is Jellyfin Right for You?

If you're looking for a powerful, flexible, and privacy-focused way to manage and stream your personal media collection, Jellyfin is an excellent choice. It empowers you with complete control over your media empire, without being tied to proprietary services or recurring costs. While it requires more initial setup than some commercial alternatives, the benefits of true ownership and open-source freedom are well worth the effort for many users.

## So why does this website exist? ü§∑

**First and foremost - because it can.** In the big picture, though, the whole point of this website is to provide a centralized resource for my friends, colleagues, and followers to get easier access to my guides without me having to email back and forth documentation. At the moment, the site doesn't have much content, but I am combing through my Obsidian.md library to find the best items to drop in here, and will continue to add to this website as time passes.

## But Ryan, LinuxServer.io, and other resources already exist! üò§

Yep, and much of the content on this website is inspired by those resources, and many others that were found in the depths of old forums, Stack Overflow, and the underside of my passenger car seat cushion. I have very *specific* tastes, which has (un)fortunately led me to find some tools that have been of great use.

This website serves as a central repository (pun intended), codex, encyclopedia, code nodepad, and so much more both for myself, and I wanted that information to be available to others.
